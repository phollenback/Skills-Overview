<b align="center">Although this project is minor in comparison to what I will be doing in the future, this project was completed almost 2 years ago in my first introduction to markup languages/programming. But, it's given me enough familiarity to apply all the design frameworks and tags to my future projects, including those I'm currently in the midst of developing, such as a java based website that emulates a blog, and a online version of "Minesweeper".</b>
