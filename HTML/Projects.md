    In this project I incorperate all I learned when it comes to the bootstrap framework as well as CSS. Although this project is minor in comparison to what I will be doing in the future, this project was completed almost 2 years ago in my first introduction to markup languages/programming. But, it's given me enough familiarity to apply all the design frameworks and tags to my future projects, including those I'm currently in the midst of developing, such as a java based website that emulates a blog, and a online version of "Minesweeper".

    This project has a bootstrap extension which allowed me to easily include button groups, navbar's, toggling content carousels and flexbox containers.

    My knowledge of the bootstrap framework allows me to quickly be able to create or enhance a unique prototype website. This project also utilizes countless lines of CSS styling that made for a personalized UI on every page.
