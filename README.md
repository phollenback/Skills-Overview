<p align = "center">A review of my knowledge of Programming Principles and the application of what I have learned in the following Languages: C#, Java, SQL, and HTML + CSS, as well as what I have learned about industry tools such as flowcharts, UML class diagrams, and GITHUB. Followed by a overview of some personal projects I have made recently.</p>

<h1 align="center">My most ambitious project to date, <b><i>Pi Piper</i></b></h1>

<p align="center">The proposed app will fully digitize and automate the restaurant’s prep list and order management system. On the admin side of the app, it will compare prices between suppliers, generate the most cost-effective orders, and offer suggestions based on past data and current needs. Also, exclusively on the admin side will feature a prep list and ingredient CRUD tool. There will also be business insight tools by incorporating PowerBi and analyzing ingredient turnover. Development is only getting started, so keep up with my progress <a href="http://github.com/phollenback/Pi-Piper">here.</a></p>

<h1>Resume Reputation</h1>
<h2 align="center">Applying to 50 jobs a day like me? Give yourself a tool to make the process less cluttered.</h1>
<p align="center">Resume-Reputation is a tool that anyone can use to keep track of what they submit to specific employers. There's become such a need to create thousands of instances of one resume so that applicants can try and find the "keyword sweetspot". On top of that, there is also a point system that works rewards points to applicants who follow good practice POST-applying. Points are rewarded for utilizing cover letters, follow up calls, emails, and all the things that will help to get you the job, not to mention there is lots of points for landing interviews, screening calls, getting job offers, etc. In the future I want to add a global and user leaderboard that allows users to compare there "Resume Reputation" to others. Use this app to save all your resume instances in one place and compare your resume reputation to others. Keep up with my progress <a href="https://github.com/phollenback/Resume-Reputation/blob/main/README.md#resume-reputation">here.</a></p>
