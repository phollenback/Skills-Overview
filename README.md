<p align = "center">A review of my knowledge of Programming Principles and the application of what I have learned in the following Languages: C#, Java, SQL, and HTML + CSS, as well as what I have learned about industry tools such as flowcharts, UML class diagrams, and GITHUB. Followed by a overview of some personal projects I have made recently.</p>

<br/>

<h1 align="center">My most ambitious project to date, <b><i>Pi Piper</i></b></h1>

<p align="center">The proposed app will fully digitize and automate the restaurant’s prep list and order management system. On the admin side of the app, it will compare prices between suppliers, generate the most cost-effective orders, and offer suggestions based on past data and current needs. Also, exclusively on the admin side will feature a prep list and ingredient CRUD tool. There will also be business insight tools by incorporating PowerBi and analyzing ingredient turnover. Development is only getting started, so keep up with my progress <a href="http://github.com/phollenback/Pi-Piper">here.</a></p>

<h2> The following are a few recent personal projects. I set out to gain a better understanding of web servers and to learn some technologies I had not yet touched before these projects, as well as make something that I can use in my daily life.</h2>

      <b>For my own personal use:</b> I created a web service to help users catalog there collection and wantlist according to a vinyl marketplace called discogs. For this project, I attempted to create nearly the full application in react and next in an attempt to demonstrate how to upgrade a react application to a next application.
