   - The 'base' of any inheritence relationship starts with the "Base" or "Parent" class. In this example, the 'salable'
    class is the bass of the three classes beneath it.


--------------------------

   -   Because the bottom three classes have an 'extends' line realationship to there base class, this means that all three inherit each       property and method its parent class contains.

-  The interface class is used to enforce what the derived classes implement
